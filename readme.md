FDF

This project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of arelief landscape
linking various points(x, y, z) via segments.
The coordinates and colors of this landscape are stored in a file passed as parameter to the program.

Here is a map example: [42.fdf](map_examples/42.fdf)

__NOTE:__
The whole project was realized using the school's graphic library: MinilibX.
This library contains only basic drawing functions: open a window, lit a pixel and manage events.
Everything else must be coded by students. (ex. file parsing, pixel coloring, rotations...).

Realized bonus:
- If the maps doesn't contain color information, the color changes according to altitude.
- The color spectrum can be specified as parameter.
- Change types of projection and real time rotations.
- Altitude can be changed in real time.
